# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
Facial Emotion Recognition using the FER-2013 dataset involves preprocessing images, designing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion classification, and optimizing the model. The project aims to achieve real-time emotion recognition through webcam input, providing a practical solution for human-computer interaction applications.
